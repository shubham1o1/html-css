## Hamburger Menu Overlay:

- Responsive Menu
- Without javascript(click event)
- We have used the checkbox input and styling the checked state
- When we click the menu the checked state is styled and a menu is shown, when you uncheck it goes away
- Variable in style css can be used in menu css
```css
.menu-wrap{
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 1;
}
```
- ```position:fixed;``` with ```z-index``` puts the element in front of other elements and it is not effected by scolling, it remains in one fixed position

- We can use ~ selector to selector different unrelated elements.
